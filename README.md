# Canon.Eos.Framework (Alpha Version) 

Canon.Eos.Framework tries to provide a better and more convenient way to integrate the [Canon EOS SDK](http://www.didp.canon-europa.com/) into .NET applications.
You still need to apply for and download the original SDK which includes all the DLLs.

## How to use it

See the included sample program for details.
